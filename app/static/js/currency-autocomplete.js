    { value: 'Termination Agreement', data: "Termination of employment is an employee\'s departure from a job. Termination may be voluntary on the employee\'s part, or it may be at the hands of the employer, often in the form of dismissal (firing) or a layoff. Dismissal or firing is generally thought to be the fault of the employee, whereas a layoff is generally done for business reasons (for instance a business slowdown or an economic downturn) outside the employee\'s performance.Firing carries a stigma in many cultures, and may hinder the jobseeker's chances of finding new employment, particularly if he or she has been sacked from previous jobs. Jobseekers sometimes do not mention jobs from which they were fired on their résumés; accordingly, unexplained gaps in employment, and refusal or failure to contact previous employers are often regarded as 'red flags'"},
